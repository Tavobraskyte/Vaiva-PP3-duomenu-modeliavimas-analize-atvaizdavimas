Section 1: Getting and Knowing Your Data
Objective: Load, explore, and understand the dataset structure and key statistics.
Key Tasks:
Import libraries and datasets.
Assign variables and set indexes.
Analyze the dataset with operations like slicing, counting, and summarizing.
Work with basic attributes like columns, datatypes, and indices.


Section 2: Filtering and Sorting
Objective: Apply filtering and sorting techniques to refine datasets.
Key Tasks:
Filter data based on conditions.
Sort datasets by specific columns.
Subset data and calculate statistical measures like averages.


Section 3: Grouping
Objective: Perform group-by operations and aggregate data.
Key Tasks:
Group data by categories.
Compute statistics like mean, median, min, and max for groups.
Analyze grouped data to extract meaningful insights.


Section 4: Apply
Objective: Practice the application of functions across columns and rows.
Key Tasks:
Transform data types and indices.
Group and summarize data by specific criteria.
Work with advanced grouping logic (e.g., decades).


Section 5: Merge
Objective: Combine datasets using merging and joining techniques.
Key Tasks:
Merge datasets along rows and columns.
Perform inner and outer joins based on matching keys.
Handle multi-dataset merges effectively.


Section 6: Stats
Objective: Analyze and manipulate datasets with missing values.
Key Tasks:
Handle missing data (NaN) with filling and deletion.
Compute statistics across rows and columns.
Downsample data by time intervals (yearly, monthly, weekly).


Section 7: Visualization
Objective: Explore data through visualizations.
Key Tasks:
Create visualizations like pie charts, scatterplots, and histograms.
Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for graphical representations.
Answer specific questions through visuals.

Section 8: Creating Series and DataFrames
Objective: Create custom Pandas Series and DataFrames from scratch.
Key Tasks:
Build and modify DataFrames.
Add and reorder columns.
Perform column-specific operations.


Section 9: Time Series
Objective: Analyze time-series data effectively.
Key Tasks:
Work with datetime data types.
Resample data to various time frequencies.
Plot trends and analyze key statistics.


Section 10: Deleting
Objective: Practice deleting rows and columns in datasets.
Key Tasks:
Remove specific rows and columns.
Handle and clean missing data.
Reset indices and manage dataset integrity.
